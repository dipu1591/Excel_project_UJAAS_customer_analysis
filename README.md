# Interactive Dashboard Using Microsoft Excel to Analyze Data and Identify Potential Customers: A Case Study of UJAAS

Microsoft Excel is a powerful tool for data analysis, and data analysts can leverage its features to streamline their work and gain valuable insights.

<br/>

<br/>

# Problem



<br/>

<br/>

UJAAS is an international brand who manufactures and sells bike in Bangladesh. They basically maintain two datasets, where in the first dataset, they collect the personal information of the potential customer, and in the second dataset, there is information about whether the potential customer purchased a bike or not. UJAAS wants to increase their market share in Bangladesh by making informed decisions using this data. Specifically, the CEO of UJAAS had a total of six questions, based on which the stakeholders will decide in the board meeting how to further increase the market share. The questions are:

1) What is the minimum income, average income, and maximum income of male and female potential customers?

2) In which salary range did customers buy more bikes?

3) How far did the customers who bought the bike typically travel each day?

4) Which age group of customers is more dependent on bikes?

5) Show the percentage of customers who have or have not purchased a bike by gender and marital status.

6) For those who are buying bikes, how many cars have they bought before?

# Solution

To merge both the two datasets, I took the help of 'Power Query Editor'. I clicked on 'Merge Queries as New' from the 'Merge Queries' option and merged two datasets based on the ID column.

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

Then, for ease of understanding, the values of the marital status and gender columns have been renamed through 'Replace Values'. Then I divided the total income range of all visitors into 10 income categories, where Scale J means income between 0 and 20000 taka, and thus specified Scale I to A for every 20000 taka. As with income range, I divided visitor age and average daily commuted distance into multiple categories.

<br/>

<br/>



'Pivot Table' and 'Chart' have been added to separate sheets for each answer. 'Conditional Formatting' has also been added for ease of understanding in pivot tables. All charts are added to a single sheet for CEO viewing, along with multiple 'slicers'. Slicer basically works as a filter. By clicking on one or more options, the value can be seen on all the charts at once. Moreover, 'Hyperlink Navigation' has been added to all sheets for ease of use.

<br/>

As all the stakeholders have no technical background, a presentation was made using simplified Excel charts to facilitate their understanding in the board meeting.
